# Instagram Format
> This is a Photoshop script meant to reformat images for use on Instagram.


## About
I wanted a quicker and easier way to format all of my photos for use in Instagram.
This script takes any image and reformats it as:
* A square image with borders
* A square image without borders
* A 16:9 image cropped for Stories


## Usage
Download the `generate.jsx` file and place it in Photoshop's Scripts folder
PC:
```shell script
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [VERSION]\Presets\Scripts
```
Mac:
```shell script
/Applications/Adobe Photoshop [VERSION]/Presets/Scripts/
```

With a photo open in Photoshop, navigate to the File > Scripts menu. The formatted versions will be saved into the same folder as the current image.
